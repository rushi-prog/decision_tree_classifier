# decision_tree_classifier
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using a Decision Tree Classifier on a heart-related dataset. It involves data preprocessing (label encoding, scaling), training a base model, and then improving performance through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Pre-pruning techniques are applied to avoid overfitting, and feature importance analysis helps interpret the model. The goal is to build a reliable and interpretable classifier with solid generalization performance.
